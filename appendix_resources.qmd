title: "Code & Data Resources"
---

This appendix lists the standalone **R scripts** and **datasets** that accompany the book. You can open these files directly in your IDE, or source/load them from R.

## R Scripts

The following `.R` files live in the project root:

- `Intros.R`
- `Statistical_Modeling.R`
- `data Exploration.R`
- `data_pipeline.R`
- `dlyr.R`
- `ggplot.R`
- `mixture_normal.R`
- `some_examples.R`

### Using the scripts

```r
# From within the project root
source("Intros.R")
source("Statistical_Modeling.R")
# ...and so on for other scripts
```

You can copy relevant functions or code chunks from these scripts into your own analysis projects.

## Datasets

All example datasets are stored in the `datasets/` folder:

- `datasets/_f733a70b3d11467ca6c77f726ac01bd2_C1_M3_L1_Finance_insurance_data.csv`
- `datasets/health_bioinformatics.json`
- `datasets/system_design.xlsx`

### Loading the datasets in R

```r
# CSV data (finance/insurance)
finance_data <- read.csv(
  "datasets/_f733a70b3d11467ca6c77f726ac01bd2_C1_M3_L1_Finance_insurance_data.csv",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# JSON data (health / bioinformatics)
library(jsonlite)
health_data <- fromJSON("datasets/health_bioinformatics.json")

# Excel data (system design)
library(readxl)
system_design <- read_excel("datasets/system_design.xlsx")
```

These data files are used throughout the course for demonstrations and exercises. Feel free to explore them interactively as you read the chapters.
